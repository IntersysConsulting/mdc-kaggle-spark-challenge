# MDC Spark Challenges

This repository contains a set of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)
challenges for batch processing, machine learning and streaming. 

## Requirements

The challenges described in this repository are expected to be completed using the 
[Scala Programming Language](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and the [Scala Build Tool](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

* Proficiency in the Scala programming language 2.11.x, sbt, and popular libraries (e.g. [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/)).
* Proficiency using Apache Spark 2.3.x
* Experience creating REST APIs with Scala (e.g. [Akka Http](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/))
* Experience with [Mongodb](https://mongodb.com) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). 
* Ability to learn and solve problems. 

## Challenges

The scope of each challenge aims to represent a complete scenario for batch-processing, machine learning, and streaming. 
Therefore, the evaluators will not only look at the usage of Apache Spark for each challenge. 
They will also assess the ability of the data-engineer to provide a clean, functional and robust solution. 
This implies the evaluation of clean code, best practices, among others. 

### Batch Processing: Gutenberg Words

The batch-processing challenge consists on analyzing and deriving insight form the text contained 
on the books of the [Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

* **Problem 1** Zipf's Law
* **Problem 2** Word Prediction Database
* **Problem 3** Word Prediction Engine

### Machine Learning: Kickstarter Projects

The machine-learning challenge consists on creating and deploying a ML model to predict [Kickstarter projects](https://www.kickstarter.com/)
using Apache Spark and [Openscoring](https://openscoring.io/).

* **Problem 1** ML Algorithm
* **Problem 2** ML Scoring

### Streaming 

To be defined.
